# TODO:
- How do I print to the console through an ST-Link?
    - RX/TX connector from St-Link need to be wired to the TX/RX pins of the MCU
    - you probably need StMicroelectronics STLink Virtual COM Port driver installed somewhere (dev/tty folder or file)

- why is my intellisense not detecting errors prior to building?
    google "gcc arm problem matcher vscode"

## FreeRTOS Configuration
Could all this not be done just using a timer? Or is that what an RTOS essential is?
```
 * Task 1:
 * - executes at a frequency of 1 quarter note
 * - updates tempo / timer to match external clock
 * 
 * Task 2:
 * - executes at a frequency of PPQN
 * - advances the sequencer
 * - handles any interface changes (ie. touch, bend, UI buttons)
 * - updates LEDs
 * - updates DACs
 * 
 * Task 3:
 * - executes at a frequency of PPQN * 8? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 * - reads and filters ADCs
 * 
 * Task 4:
 * - low priority for printf()
 * 
 * State Struct:
 * - is shared globally between tasks
 * - holds a series of "flags" for which to tell each task which code it should execute
```

## Toolchain

#### Install OpenOCD for ST-Link Debugging
```
brew install openocd
```

#### Install ARM Embedded Toolchain
```
# not sure about the brew tap, but it works.
brew tap PX4/homebrew-px4
brew update
brew install gcc-arm-none-eabi
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

#### Pull submodules
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Making changed to git submodules
First, `cd` into the submodule directory and checkout a new branch with `git checkout -b myBranchName`

You can now commit changes and push to the remote

## Bootloader
No external pull-up resistor is required

Bootloader ID: 0x90

Memory location: 0x1FFF76DE

### Install [dfu-util](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/)
```
brew install dfu-util
```

To enter bootloader mode, hold down `BOOT`, then, hold down `RESET`. Release `RESET` button (before releasing `BOOT`)

Run `dfu-util -l` and you should see the following output:
```
dfu-util 0.11

### Using `dfuse-pack.py`
This file was pulled from the `dfu-util` repo, and is meant to convert `.hex` files into `.dfu` files.
Note: Make sure you have the `IntelHex` python module installed.

See make file for usage.
